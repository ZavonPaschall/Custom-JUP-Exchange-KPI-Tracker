# Custom Jupiter Exchange KPI Tracker

In a market where no product currently provides a comprehensive view of trading activities on Jupiter Exchange, I built this dashboard to fill that gap. This dashboard helps users track their total trading volume, transaction history and more on Jupiter Exchange (Jup.ag). By entering a Solana wallet address, users can quickly view their swap, DCA (Dollar-Cost Averaging), limit order volumes, transaction counts and much more.

**Key Features:**
- **Comprehensive Trade Tracking:** Monitor your trading activity across various strategies like swaps, DCA, and limit orders on Jupiter Exchange.
- **User-Friendly Interface:** Simply paste your wallet address and click 'Apply' to see detailed insights into your trading history.
- **Market Data:** Get up-to-date information on your trading performance, including volume, slippage, and staking rewards.

**Skills Demonstrated:**
- **SQL and Data Analysis:** Using SQL to analyze and aggregate transaction data, providing clear insights into user trading activities.
- **Blockchain Data Handling:** Expertise in working with Solana blockchain data, including trade details and transaction fees.
- **Dashboard Development:** Building interactive dashboards that present real-time data in a meaningful and user-friendly way.

**Why It Matters:**
This dashboard illustrates my ability to build tools that transform complex blockchain data into actionable insights, making it easier for users to understand and optimize their trading strategies. The project showcases my proficiency in SQL, data visualization, and blockchain technology, which are essential skills for roles in data-driven decision-making, fintech, and blockchain development.
